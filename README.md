About
=====
This is a wrapper for [Duc](https://github.com/zevv/duc/).

The wrapper uses the Duc for indexing files in directories and adds [magic](https://linux.die.net/man/5/magic) info to all entries in the Duc database. This can be used to quickly identify filetypes on your filesystem.

Usage
====

```
git clone https://github.com/WillemJan/ducmagic/
pip install .
ducmagic ls /
```
